## Project Overview

In this collaborative project, we utilized R Studio for data analysis and GitHub for version control. Our analysis encompasses various key topics, including:

- **Data Wrangling:** Identification and handling of missing values and outliers.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Addressing crucial questions related to life expectancy through the application of diverse statistical tools, such as t-tests, ANOVA, Pearson correlation coefficient, and more.
- **Linear Regression:** Handling multicollinearity (high VIF), implementing feature selection using forward/backward selection, lasso/ridge regression, and conducting model comparison.
- **Classification:** Dataset balancing via techniques like ROSE and ovun.sample and application of different basic classifiers, including Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, Linear Discriminant Analysis, Quadratic Discriminant Analysis, and k-Nearest Neighbors.
